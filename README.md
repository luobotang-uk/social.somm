# Social Somm

### Project Overview  
Social Somm is a platform designed to democratize fine wine. It enables wine enthusiasts to enjoy premium bottles by splitting costs with others at social events. For example, a €100 bottle can be shared among four people at €25 each or five people at €20 each.  

By making fine wine accessible and social, the platform allows users—called “social somms”—to connect, meet up, and share exceptional bottles by the glass.  

### Key Features  
- Create or join wine-sharing events  
- Automated cost-splitting for shared bottles  
- User profiles with preferences and event history  
- Booking and RSVP functionality  
- Build community connections among wine enthusiasts  

### Technology Stack  
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth  
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for cost sharing  
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), AWS/DigitalOcean (backend), Supabase/Heroku (database)  

### Setup Instructions  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-somm.git
   cd social-somm
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with:  
   - Database connection string  
   - Stripe API key  
   - JWT secret or OAuth keys  
4. Run database migrations  
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. Start the development server  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.  

### Business Context  
The fine wine industry is often exclusive, with high costs creating barriers to entry. Social Somm removes these barriers by letting people share premium bottles affordably, turning wine tasting into a social and communal experience.  

It taps into three major trends:  
- Growth of the experience economy  
- Rising global interest in premium and natural wines  
- Increasing demand for community-driven digital platforms  

By merging cost-sharing with social discovery, Social Somm makes fine wine more accessible, more memorable, and more scalable as a business.
